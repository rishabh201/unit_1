## üìù PURPOSE OF THIS SCRIPT


The starter_kit.sh script is designed to quickly set up a basic project structure.  
It creates a project/ folder with three subdirectories:  

   - `scripts/` ‚Üí for code and automation scripts  
   - `docs/` ‚Üí for documentation files  
   - `data/` ‚Üí for datasets or raw inputs  

Each folder, including the main project/ folder, gets a placeholder README.md file to explain its purpose.  
This ensures consistency and helps team members navigate the project easily.  

At the end, the script displays ‚ÄúStarter Kit Ready!‚Äù to confirm that the setup was completed successfully.
