## Extra_Question 

1. Purpose of #!/bin/bash at the top of a script
=> This line is called a shebang.
It tells the system which interpreter to use to run the script.
#!/bin/bash specifically tells the system to run the script using Bash.
Without it, the script may not run correctly, or it may be run by a different shell (like sh), which could cause errors.

2. How to make a script executable
=> there are two ways - 
a. Open the terminal.
Use the chmod command to give execute permission. For example:
chmod +x script_name.sh

script_name.sh → Name of your script.

After that, run the script with:
./script_name.sh

b. using 
bash script_name.sh
